<h1>About Bunny the dev</h1>
<p>Hey! Hope youre doing well today. I'm glad you found my portfolio! Come closer lets have a chat,</p>

<p>there are a few things I want to let you know about me. One is that I havent been coding for long, 
  I'd say im on my fourth month and im really loveing it. I find myself often thinking about it in my free 
  time or find myself looking foward to getting to learn something new or write some code after I get home 
  from my full time job. Full time job?! Yes. 
  Full. Time. Job. I am currently the onwer/oporater of a small business in Washington state, 
  my business has been open and serving the community since 2007 and under my operation since 2015 but has 
  remained family owned 100% of those years. I had pondered learning how to code for some time thinking it might be time 
  for a career change but it alwasy left me thinking that I wasnt capable, well mainly smart enough and well here I am. I guess I didnt
   give my brain enough credit.  </p>

<p>
  Im excited to continue this journy, to keep growing and learning and really mastering the skill, ya know?
  Come back soon okay? I might have some actual cool stuff on here soon! 
  Bye!!
